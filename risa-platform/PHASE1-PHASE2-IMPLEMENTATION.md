```

## üìä Analytics Implementation

      } 
    }
  `
});

// Weekly Appointments
const weeklyAppointments = await twentyClient.query({
  query: gql`
    query { 
      opportunities(filter: { 
        closeDate: { gte: WEEK_START, lte: WEEK_END } 
      }) { 
        totalCount 
      } 
    }
  `
});

# Patient Portal Authentication Fix

## The Issue
The patient portal login was successful but the dashboard redirect wasn't working properly because:
1. The authentication cookie is HttpOnly (for security)
2. The dashboard was trying to check authentication by reading cookies directly
3. Cookie handling between different ports (8080 for frontend, 5001 for backend) needed proper configuration

## The Solution
I've implemented the following fixes:

### 1. Updated Cookie Settings (server/routes/auth.js)
- Changed `sameSite` from 'strict' to 'lax' in development mode
- Added explicit `path: '/'` to ensure cookies work across all routes
- Kept HttpOnly for security

### 2. Updated Dashboard Authentication (dashboard.js)
- Dashboard now always verifies authentication via API call to `/api/patients/profile`
- Removed dependency on reading cookies directly
- Properly syncs localStorage with API response

### 3. Added Authentication Check Endpoint (server/routes/auth.js)
- Added `/api/auth/check` endpoint for explicit auth verification
- Returns user data if authenticated

## How It Works Now

1. **Login Process**:
   - User enters credentials on patient-portal.html
   - API sets HttpOnly cookie and returns user data
   - Frontend stores auth state in localStorage as backup
   - Redirects to dashboard.html

2. **Dashboard Load**:
   - dashboard.js immediately calls API to verify authentication
   - API checks the HttpOnly cookie automatically
   - If valid, returns user data and dashboard loads
   - If invalid, redirects back to login

3. **Session Persistence**:
   - Cookie lasts 7 days
   - Each API call includes the cookie automatically
   - Dashboard verifies on each load

## Testing the Fix

1. Visit http://localhost:8080/test-login-flow.html
2. Click buttons in order:
   - Clear All Auth Data
   - Login as John Doe
   - Check Auth Status
   - Go to Dashboard

The dashboard should now load properly after login!

## Security Notes
- Cookies remain HttpOnly for security
- CORS properly configured for local development
- Production will use 'strict' sameSite for additional security

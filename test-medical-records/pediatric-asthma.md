8-year-old boy with history of asthma diagnosed at age 4, referred for poor asthma control despite current therapy. Mother reports frequent use of albuterol rescue inhaler (5-6 times per week), nocturnal coughing 3-4 nights per week, and exercise limitation during PE class. Current on Fluticasone (Flovent) HFA 44mcg, 2 puffs BID. Compliance reported as good. Two ED visits in past 6 months for asthma exacerbations requiring oral prednisone.

## Triggers

- Cat dander (family has 2 cats)

## Past Medical History
- Eczema (atopic dermatitis) - well controlled with moisturizers
- Allergic rhinitis
- Recurrent otitis media (PE tubes placed age 3)
- No prior hospitalizations for asthma

## Medications
- Fluticasone HFA 44mcg, 2 puffs BID
- Albuterol HFA PRN
- Loratadine 5mg PO daily
- Montelukast 5mg PO qHS (recently started by PCP)

## Allergies
- Amoxicillin (rash)

## Family History
- Mother: Allergic rhinitis
- Father: Eczema
- Maternal grandmother: Asthma

## Physical Examination
- **Vital Signs**: T 37.0Â°C, HR 92, RR 20, BP 100/65, O2 sat 96% RA
- **General**: Alert, cooperative, no acute distress
- **HEENT**: Allergic shiners, boggy nasal turbinates, cobblestoning of posterior pharynx
- **Lungs**: Mild expiratory wheezing bilaterally, no rales or rhonchi
- **Heart**: RRR, no murmurs
- **Skin**: Dry patches on antecubital fossae consistent with eczema
- **Extremities**: No clubbing or cyanosis

## Diagnostic Studies
### Spirometry (Pre-bronchodilator)
- FEV1: 75% predicted
- FVC: 85% predicted
- FEV1/FVC: 0.72
- FEF 25-75%: 60% predicted

### Post-bronchodilator
- FEV1: 88% predicted (17% improvement)
- Significant bronchodilator response

### Skin Testing
Positive reactions to:
- Dust mites (4+)
- Cat dander (3+)
- Tree pollen mix (2+)
- Mold mix (2+)

## Assessment
1. Moderate persistent asthma, inadequately controlled
2. Allergic rhinitis
3. Atopic dermatitis
4. Environmental allergies

## Treatment Plan

### Step-Up Therapy
1. Increase to medium-dose ICS: Fluticasone HFA 110mcg, 2 puffs BID
2. Add LABA: Change to combination Fluticasone/Salmeterol (Advair) HFA 115/21mcg, 2 puffs BID
3. Continue Montelukast 5mg qHS
4. Albuterol HFA 2 puffs q4-6h PRN

### Environmental Controls
- Dust mite covers for mattress and pillows
- HEPA filter for bedroom
- Consider rehoming cats (family reluctant)
- No smoking in home (confirmed already smoke-free)

### Additional Management
1. Updated Asthma Action Plan provided
2. Spacer device prescribed for MDI technique
3. Influenza vaccine annually
4. Consider allergen immunotherapy if control remains poor

### Education
- Proper inhaler technique demonstrated and confirmed
- Trigger avoidance strategies discussed
- Importance of controller medication adherence emphasized

## Follow-up
- Return in 6-8 weeks for reassessment
- Repeat spirometry at next visit
- Call if increased rescue inhaler use or nighttime symptoms

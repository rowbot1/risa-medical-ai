## Treatment Recommendations

### Adjuvant Chemotherapy
Given high-risk features (node positive, high Ki-67, high Oncotype score), recommend:
1. **AC-T Protocol**:
   - Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) 60 mg/m² + Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m² IV q3 weeks x 4 cycles
   - Followed by Paclitaxel 80 mg/m² IV weekly x 12 weeks

### Endocrine Therapy
Following chemotherapy completion:
- **Premenopausal**: Tamoxifen 20mg PO daily x 5 years with ovarian suppression (Goserelin 3.6mg SC monthly)
- Consider switching to Aromatase Inhibitor if becomes postmenopausal

### Supportive Medications
- Ondansetron 8mg PO/IV PRN nausea
- Dexamethasone 12mg PO pre-chemotherapy
- Filgrastim support as needed for neutropenia
- Consider Palonosetron for delayed nausea

### Additional Recommendations
1. Radiation therapy consultation for adjuvant radiation
2. Genetic counseling given age and tumor characteristics
3. Baseline ECHO or MUGA before doxorubicin
4. Fertility preservation discussion if desires future pregnancy
5. Dental evaluation before bisphosphonate therapy

## Follow-up Plan
- Start chemotherapy in 2 weeks pending cardiac evaluation
- Weekly CBC during treatment
- See patient prior to each chemotherapy cycle
- Tumor markers (CA 15-3, CEA) at baseline and every 3-6 months
